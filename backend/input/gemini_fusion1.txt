Your task is to compare the provided Software Requirement Specification (SRS) with the provided User Stories. Identify which requirements in the SRS are not covered or reflected in the User Stories, and also which User Stories imply additional requirements that are not stated in the SRS. You must always rreturn the result as a valid Python list of strings ["requirement 1", "requirement 2", "requirement 3", ...]. Rules: 1. Do not output any plain text explanations — only return the dictionary. 2. Each element must be a clear, single, actionable item. 3. If all items are covered, return empty lists for both keys. 4. When identifying a requirement from a User Story as 'implied' (not in the SRS), you must first verify it is not already covered by a requirement in the `SRS` that uses different terminology.", 8. The check for 'missing' `SRS` requirements must be exhaustive; a requirement is only 'missing' if no User Story or combination of User Stories implements its core functionality., 9. The string for each item must clearly state the source of the gap (e.g., 'SRS 3.1.2 is not covered' or 'User Story 9.1 implies a new payment-gateway requirement')."
