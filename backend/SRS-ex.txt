PROJECT SUMMARY

To build a simple web app that allows composing/inputting text, selecting a voice (multiple options), generating audio (MP3/WAV), saving/retrieving, and scheduling daily internal broadcasts. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) goal is: fast, easy-to-use for political officers, and low initial cost. If conditions allow, expand to include fine-tuning / cloning capabilities for the voices of comrades with good vocal quality (with their consent) to achieve a more "real" and natural sound.

1. Objectives & Scope

Primary Goal (MVP)

Convert text-to-speech (TTS) directly on the web.

Provide >3 default voices (various styles: male/female, speed, resonance).

Allow exporting audio files (MP3/WAV).

Support a "Preview" feature (listen to a short segment) and "Generate Full" (create a file for the entire content).

Allow saving generated content and managing a broadcast schedule for daily internal broadcasts.

Out of Scope (Initial Phase)

Advanced voice cloning/training (this is an advanced feature, detailed below).

Complex integration with specific internal systems (requires a separate request).

2. Functional Requirements / User Stories

As a User (Political Officer), I can:

Log in/Register (simple, can use internal LDAP if required).

Input or paste text; optionally upload .txt/.docx files.

Select a voice from a dropdown: Voice A, Voice B, Voice C.

Select speed (slow/normal/fast) and basic pitch/intonation.

Press "Preview" to listen to a 30–60s segment.

Press "Generate" to create the full audio, download as MP3/WAV.

Save the broadcast to a Library (name, description, creation date).

Schedule the broadcast for the system to automatically play/prepare the file for the internal broadcast time.

As an Administrator, I can:

Manage voices (add/remove/toggle), manage users, view history.

View logs and statistics: total minutes generated, storage usage.

The System must:

Support a minimum of 30 minutes of continuous generation (approx. 6,000–7,000 words; estimated 30k–42k characters based on internal calculation: 6-7k words ≈ 30,000–42,000 characters).

Allow saving audio files on the server or object storage (S3/GCS).

3. Non-functional Requirements

Preview Response Time: < 10s for a 20–30s segment (depends on TTS tech).

Durability (30-min): Support exporting files >30 minutes (chunking if needed).

Security: HTTPS, authentication, authorization. If voice cloning is used, must store consent forms and audit logs.

Scalability: Microservice/worker architecture for easy upgrades (separate inference worker).

Backup/Retention: Default 30-day retention, configurable.

4. Proposed Architecture (High-Level)

Frontend: React (or Vue) — Single Page Application, text editor, preview player, dashboard.

Backend: Node.js / Python (FastAPI) — API for: creating TTS jobs, getting status, saving metadata, managing users.

TTS Layer (Two implementation options):

Cloud TTS API (Google Cloud Text-to-Speech / ElevenLabs / other): Call API, receive audio. (Pros: fast, high-quality, low-maintenance). (Google has a free tier for 1M WaveNet/4M Standard characters — see pricing page).

Self-hosted Open-Source (Coqui TTS, XTTS, viXTTS for Vietnamese, etc.): Deploy models on server/GPU, local inference, allows fine-tuning/cloning. (Coqui TTS is a popular toolkit).

Queue & Worker: Redis + Celery / RQ to process audio generation jobs (especially for long texts).

Storage: Object storage (MinIO/S3) for audio files, metadata in PostgreSQL.

Scheduler: Cron-like service or backend job scheduler for broadcast scheduling.

5. Details on Advanced Feature (Voice cloning / style transfer)

Objective: If possible, "analyze" and clone the voice of a comrade to create a more natural-sounding voice.

Technical & Legal Requirements: Requires audio samples from the person (at least several minutes—more is better); must have written consent; store consent and logs.

Technology: Voice-clone models can be fine-tuned (e.g., open-source repos for voice cloning, or commercial services like ElevenLabs). Self-hosting allows data control but requires powerful GPUs for training/tuning.

6. Acceptance Criteria

User A can paste a ~6,000-word text and generate a ~30-minute MP3/WAV file without errors (file creates and downloads successfully).

At least 3 default voices are available; preview works in <15s.

The system allows saving + scheduling daily broadcasts and displays a history.

Logs/admin interface can show the 10 newest records and delete unnecessary files.

If voice-cloning is implemented: must have electronic signature for consent, and the system must return a sample voice for testing before wide use.

7. UI/UX (Brief)

Main Page: Large editor (paste text), voice selection (dropdown with sample-play), speed slider, Preview / Generate / Save / Schedule buttons.

Library: List of generated articles, filter by date, Play/Download/Delete buttons.

Admin: User management, voice management, logs.
(A wireframe can be drawn if you wish.)

8. Implementation Options & Cost (Analysis of 3 options)

Here are 3 options—corresponding to the feasibility within your stated budget (4–5 million VND) and if more budget is available.

Option A: MVP (Ultra Low-Cost) (Using cloud TTS free/low-cost) — Fits 4–5M VND (if you only pay for small implementation or DIY):

Uses Google Cloud TTS (or services like ElevenLabs) to quickly get natural voices. Google has a large free tier for characters per month.

Simple backend + frontend deployed on a cheap VPS; audio stored in cloud storage.

Estimated Cost: Development (if hiring a small freelancer) might exceed 4–5M VND. However, if you or your unit has an internal dev, an MVP could be deployed within this range (mostly server + API usage costs). Cloud TTS cost for 30 min (≈36k–42k chars) is within the free tier (if not used heavily).

Option B: Self-hosted Open-Source (Coqui / viXTTS) — Advanced, requires upfront hardware cost:

Deploy Coqui TTS / viXTTS on a server with a GPU (Rec: GPU ~8GB VRAM for light inference; training/cloning needs 16GB+).

Pros: Full control, can fine-tune/clone. Cons: Requires capital investment for hardware or renting cloud GPUs (higher cost).

Estimated Cost: If buying a new GPU/PC, the cost far exceeds 4–5M VND. If renting cloud GPUs (by the hour), operating costs will be higher than using a dedicated cloud TTS service.

Option C: Hybrid (Pre-generate + schedule):

Use cloud TTS to pre-generate files (batch) for 30 days → save them. Reduces real-time API call costs, suitable for a fixed broadcast schedule.

This is the most economical choice for API usage & internal broadcasts.

9. Specific Figures (for illustration)

Text Size: 6,000–7,000 words ≈ 30,000–42,000 characters (avg. 5–6 chars/word incl. spaces).

TTS Cloud Cost: With this character count, many services (like Google) are still within the free tier for WaveNet/Standard if you don't exceed it multiple times a month. The TTS service fee can be very small initially.

10. Risks & Legal Considerations

Voice Cloning: If cloning a real person's voice, written consent is required; must comply with internal/Army regulations. Note the risk of misuse → requires audit/logs + restricted permissions.

Data Security: If the content is sensitive (political/military info), avoid third-party cloud services with unclear data policies. Prioritize self-hosting or services with clear SLAs.

Real Cost: If you want "very" natural (human-like) voices, you usually need commercial models (ElevenLabs) or significant resources to fine-tune—both have costs.
